Subject: [PATCH] stop_machine: irq_pipeline: ensure no in-band IRQ is deferred
 while stopping

We don't want any inband interrupt received to linger into the interrupt
log before we start the multi-cpu stop protocol. Swap the hard and
virtual interrupt disabling in MULTI_STOP_DISABLE_IRQ to ensure this.
