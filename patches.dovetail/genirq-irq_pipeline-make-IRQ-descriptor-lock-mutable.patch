Subject: [PATCH] genirq: irq_pipeline: make IRQ descriptor lock mutable

We need the IRQ descriptor lock to be usable both from root and head
stages indifferently, so that we can share critical portions of the
genirq core code between those stages when pipelining interrupts,
avoiding ugly code duplication.

This scheme assumes that such portions meet real-time requirements,
including the controller-specific irqchip handlers called under lock.

Using a mutable lock makes it a hard lock fully disabling
preemption for the calling context, meaning:

- both virtually (stalling the current stage and/or disabling
scheduling preemption) and physically (at CPU level) for the root
stage;

- only physically for the head stage, since we may not reschedule from
  such context anyway.
